# Booth Babes

In the office of the to-still-be-named company that Pixy works for. In this comic:

* Pixy Jones
* Penelope
* Jerry

**Panel 1**

> Penelope pops her head over the cubicle where Pixy is working.

PENELOPE

Yo, I have bad news about our convention trip next week.

PIXY

What's that?

**Panel 2**

> Wide shot of Pixy and Penelope talking with exaggeration.

PENELOPE

Jerry is coming with us!

PIXY

Ah crap! Jerry always says something stupid or sexist.

**Panel 3**

> Pixy and Penelope looking annoyed at Jerry. Jerry looks excited with his hands in the air.

JERRY

Yo! What's up ladies? You girls all ready to get booth babed up for next week?

**Panel 4**

> Similar to Panel 3 but Jerry is suddenly sad and looking down.

JERRY (Sad)

I only act this way because I have trouble relating to women in a professional setting.

PIXY

Damn it, Jerry.
