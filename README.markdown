# About the source files.

The tools I use to build this comic.

* [MyPaint] is used to both pencil and ink the comic. I save the files in multi-layer .ora or [OpenRaster] format.
* [GIMP] is used for the coloring and the export of the comic image. I publish to .png format.
* [Inkscape] is used for laying out the panels and building the talk bubbles.

Every comic will have a script that was written in Markdown. This was originally for my personal benefit but I hope this will help with translations of the comic.
